# Funadmentals of Data Analysis Assignment - 2023

### Author: Conor Tierney

**This repositiory contains a README file, a gitignore file, a tasks.ipynb file, a project.ipynb file.**

***********

This notebook was created for the Fundamantals of Data Analysis module assignment as part of the Higher Diploma in Science in Computing in Data Analytics at ATU.

The main purpose of the assignment is to source and investigate sets of data, explore and visualize data, apply basic mathematical data analysis techniques to data sets, and automate data analysis techniques.

*********

When the code is run within the notebook it ouputs arrays, plots, histograms and data summaries for visualization and analysis of the data set.

## Tasks.ipynb

The tasks notebook covers the tasks outlined to be completed over the course. The are: 

1. Collatz Conjecture  
2. Penguins data set overview
3. Penguin data set - Probability distribution
4. Entropy
5. Plotting - Penguin data set

******

## Project.ipynb

This notebook investigates the well-known Fisher's Iris dataset. The project was completed as part of the Fundamentals of Data Analysis module in the Higher Diploma in Science in Computing in Data Analytics at ATU. It explores the variables and data points within the dataset, the classification of each variable, demonstrates summary statistics, and outputs the most appropriate plots to visualize the data.

******

## Running the code 

1. Install anaconda
2. Install VScode
3. Clone the repositiory
4. Run respsitory in VScode
